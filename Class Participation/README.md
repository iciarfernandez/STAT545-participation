# Class Activities

This folder contains **in-class participation** exercises.

+ Files are named **cm** (*class meeting*) + the **number** of the class meeting where the activity was completed. 

+ *I missed the first three classes due to being in the waiting list, so I have completed the cm002 and cm003 activities on my own*.

## Links to each class folder
