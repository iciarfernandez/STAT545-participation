##### 1. Loading packages and printing out gapminder data frame to explore the output
```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tibble)
library(DT)
gapminder
```

##### 2. New Code Chunk
```{r}
tibble::as_tibble(mtcars)

- mtcars is an R built-in data set based on data extracted from the 1974 *Motor Trend* US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models). [**Here**](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/mtcars.html) you can find out more about this dataset. 

##### 4. Some more in-line code chunk specifying the number of rows in the mtcars dataset
```{r}
nrow(mtcars)
```

##### 5. Integrating the code into the document
