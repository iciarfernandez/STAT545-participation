# STAT545-participation

## Welcome to my **2019-2020** STAT545 participation repository. 

* STAT545 is all about data wrangling, workflow, and the communication aspects of data science. It is composed of two parts: 

  + **STAT545A**, in *term 1*.
  + **STAT547M**, in *term 2*.
  
* My [**Class Participation**](https://github.com/sciclic/STAT545-participation) directory contains *in-class* activities.
  
If you are interested in learning more, [here](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/) is the course website.

## About me 

My name is **IcÃ­ar**. I grew up in the small town of Zamora in northwestern Spain, and I moved to Vancouver this year to complete my MSc in Genome Science and Technology. In my free time, I enjoy reading :books:, hiking :evergreen_tree:, taking pictures :camera:, and [writing](https://scienceuntangled.wordpress.com/) about science :black_nib:!  

As Ralph Waldo Emerson said...

> Do not go where the path may lead. Go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.
